### About IPPS 
The payment made by medicare for hospital inpatient stays is based on preset rates under Part A. ​This payment system is referred to as the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS). Under the IPPS, every patient’s medical condition is grouped into a diagnosis-related group (DRG). Each DRG has a payment weight assigned to it, based on the average resources used to treat Medicare patients in that DRG. The base payment rate is divided into two parts of labor and non labour payments. Labor-related share is adjusted based on where the hospital is located. the non labor share is adjusted by a cost of living adjustment factor. This base payment rate is multiplied by the DRG relative weight.
