# Statistical Analysis of Medicare Payments
### Overview
Medicare Payments data is mergied with the Inpatient Prospect Payment System (IPPS) and the Total Performance Score(TPS) of the hospitals. Clinical Outcomes Score, Efficiency and Cost Reduction Score, Safety Score, Community and Engagement Score, these four types of hospital scores are considered to get the results. With the introduction of the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), it is assumed that all DRGs are paid out uniformly to the various hospitals with an adjustment for location and prevailing wage index. However, Medicare costs have been rising year on year. While this increase is in part due to the increasing costs of drugs and its monopolization by pharma cos, hospitals are also constantly investing money in improving their facilities. With the hospitals seeking to make a profit on their investments, the concern over hospital overbilling Medicare arises.
